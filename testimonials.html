              We are using 'Care for the Journey' tracks as a reflection before our Caring Advocate meeting,
              the group helping incorporate Jean Watson's Caring Theory into practice. We played one track at
              our last meeting and the members now want to play a track at the beginning of each of our meetings,

              We played it in our hospital lobby, decorated with banners and poster presentations from
              nursing units, for our Nurses Week celebration. The music was a soothing, calming welcome
              for patients and visitors entering the facility. What I noticed about nurses, physicians
              and other caregivers though was how the messages seemed to slow them down, to still their
              pace for a few minutes, and pull them into the space where the music was coming from.
            </p>
            <p class="ital">
              The messages do that of their own - they draw you 'in' to a quiet space inside your professional
              soul and speak more clearly than what you can put into words &hellip; what you already 'know.'
              They give meaning to what can easily be lost in the flurry of a task.
            </p>
            <p class="ital">
              In this small package of blended melodies and messages, the gift of caregiving is celebrated,
              nurtured, and witnessed with clarity for its capacity to give light and life.

              I am deeply touched by your work. I have been a critical care nurse, educator and administrator
              for 23 years. I have never encountered an audio presentation that so perfectly captured the

              health care providers. Compassion and spiritual rejuvenation for providers is like water to a

              Presented as a gift to your staff, it could be one of the more thoughtful appreciation gifts
              care givers can receive. It helps fill their emotional buckets so they can in turn reconnect
              with their own empathy and caring. When considering what you might give to those who are the
              life-blood of your organization, to let them know how much you appreciate their feelings and
              their journey, consider 'Care for the Journey'.

              For Nurses Week, I bought a copy of <em>'Care for the Journey: Messages with Music for Sustaining the Heart of Healthcare'</em> , for every one of my RN colleagues. It felt to me a good way of honoring their important
              work and their need for self-care as they travel around the country facilitating Creative
              Health Care Management's implementations of Relationship-Based Care (RBC) in hospitals and
              health systems.

              While in upstate New York recently launching an RBC implementation, I shared track #11
              ('Appreciation Montage' with Desmond Tutu) at the end of the day as an affirmation of the
              commitment they were making, and as these nurse and allied health leaders face their own
              journey to change the culture in their hospital.

              The next day, while orienting the steering team to their specific functions, I played
              Jean Watson's track 'The Caring Moment', to reinforce the caring theories we had just
              reviewed, core to the RBC curriculum. During breaks I played the instrumental tracks.

              This past Wednesday while presenting a keynote address in NYC for Nurse Week celebrations,
              I chose track #11 again to complete my remarks. The impact was profound, as evidenced by
              the tears and smiles I observed and the many comments made afterwards! I listen to this
              track often and never fail to experience a visceral response &mdash; goose bumps, tears,
              and a warmth in my heart particularly hearing the voice and message of Desmond Tutu.
              Amazing impact! So powerful!

              I attended the April, 2005, Harvard Mind/Body Institute Conference 'Spirituality and Healing'
              in Medicine in Santa Fe. At the conference, I attended the "Care for the Journey" workshop
              presented by Gary Malkin and Mary Matthiesen. I was absolutely astounded at the work.
              During the workshop, I witnessed a room full of physicians,  nurses, PAs, social workers,
              therapists and hospital chaplains moved deeply by the words and music of 'Care for the Journey'.

              I am sure that this CD will be of use to those who work in all aspects of healthcare.
              The messages are poignant &mdash; and as a previous music major, I was impressed by the
              beauty and the nuances of the accompanying scores.
              The compilation of messages and music together accomplished what the two alone could not
              do &mdash; they touched the spirit of those who heard it.

              Since the conference, I have used one of the tracks during a presentation that I gave at
              the American Academy of Physician Assistants' national conference and recommended it to
              PAs/educators there. Additionally, I plan to use the CD during my Patient Evaluation and
              Professional Development courses at the university, as well as upcoming graduation ceremonies
              for our students. The applications for 'Care for the Journey' are numerous, and I highly
              recommend it to both educators and healthcare professionals.
              I do believe that this CD will help 'sustain the heart of healthcare.'
              Thank you for your work &mdash; it has blessed me, has reminded me of the reasons for choosing
              medicine as my life's work, and has renewed me.

              'Care for the Journey' is a powerful reminder that healthcare is a mission, not just a business,

              In listening to 'Care for the Journey', I felt cared for myself.
              As a caretaker for 30+ years in dentistry and more recently for my own family, I find
              so often we are taken for granted or simply expected to perform.
              Appreciation seems infrequent, but so welcome when we hear it spoken.
              When others are put before us it's easy to forget the sound of a caretaking thought in return. Thank you!

              You may not believe this, but until I heard some of the messages on the CD, I really wasn't

              I have been a nurse since 1992, and am interested in integrating the 'Care for the Journey'
              resources into our Emergency Department.
              I have come to appreciate the importance of connecting with other human beings as I attempt
              to aid them during their time of healing, despair and even death.
              As an assistant nurse manager I am aware of the rapid burnout of my fellow peers and nurses,
              realizing the complexity and strength of what they do each day.

              of others and to help them appreciate what brought them into this profession in the first place.
              I feel strongly that the positive messages of 'Care for the Journey' can impact and change the

              It acknowledges the stresses under which we work and takes us a step back to the real meaning of healing

              I'd gone into the hospital chapel in a state of shock, weighed down by a dead and hopeless feeling.
              Listening to 'Care for the Journey' gave me a sense of hope and light.
            </p>
            <p class="ital">
              In listening to the message, 'You did the best you could with what you had at the time,' I was
              lighter just by sitting there &mdash; I was incredibly lighter&hellip; I almost had wings!
              It was a feeling that the voices were speaking just to me, and some of the sentences really touched me.
            </p>
            <p class="ital">
              They were the kind of universal statements you don't hear everyday.
              Even if you have a good friend or partner, they're often not equipped to console you the way you may need.
              Since that day my life has somehow shifted, it's more peaceful.
              I've shared the recording with my psychologist and animal rescue workers.
              It truly has the potential to help many people, if they just take the moment to listen.
