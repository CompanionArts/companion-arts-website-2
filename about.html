            Companion Arts, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization, was co-founded in 2002 by Michael Stillwaterand Gary Malkin, creators of the acclaimed audio resource, Graceful Passages:  A Companion for Livingand Dying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years Companion Arts has developed a number of customized programs for major healthcareinstitutions and audio resources for professional caregivers (Care for the Journey, Vol. 1 &amp;Vol 2, considered "new classics" in the field); we've also explored how music and messages have astrong, positive affect on individual healing (Heart of Healing&trade;).
          </p>
          <p>
            This year we've regrouped to forge new perspectives on 1) cutting edge resources for caregiversand 2) how the arts can be utilized for caregivers' benefit. Later this year these new ideas willfind rich expression in Care For The Journey&trade; programs and resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companion Arts also has an extraordinary Advisory Board as well as renown caregiving expertsadvising the Care For the Journey program.
